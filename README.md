## 📌 Notes
- This is a learning project created as part of a school Computer Science project.
- The application uses SQLite for simplicity.
- Free hosting may cause the app to sleep when inactive.

## Project Scope & Security Notes
This project is built for learning and demonstration purposes.

To keep the code simple and beginner-friendly, some production-level
features are intentionally out of scope, including:
- Authentication and authorization
- CSRF protection
- Advanced input validation
- Production-grade database setup

These would be required for real-world applications but are not the
focus of this educational project.
